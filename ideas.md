### Ideas

* Create ISO image without requiring an existing macOS physical/virtual installation.

* An Ansible playbook to automate all-the-things!

* Test `accel=hvf` flag on QEMU + macOS Mojave on MacBook Pro.

* Try https://passthroughpo.st/hackintosh-kvm-guide-high-sierra-using-qemus-i440fx-chipset/ stuff.

* https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM is cool. Shift to it but keep the older working bits.

* Document how I use this project to test open-source projects.
